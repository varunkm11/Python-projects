## Features Explained

### Quality Settings
- **JPEG Quality**: Ranges from 1 (lowest quality, smallest file) to 100 (highest quality, largest file)
- **Optimization**: Automatically enabled for PNG and JPEG formats to reduce file size

### Batch Processing
- Select multiple images at once
- All images will be converted to the same output format
- Progress tracking shows current file being processed

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handles unsupported files
- Shows detailed success/failure statistics
- Continues processing remaining files if one fails

## Technical Details

- Built with Python's tkinter for the GUI
- Uses Pillow (PIL) for image processing
- Threaded conversion to prevent UI freezing
- Automatic RGBA to RGB conversion for JPEG compatibility
- Modern styling with custom ttk themes

## System Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- Pillow library
- Sufficient disk space for converted images

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Module not found" error**: Make sure Pillow is installed
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
   ```

2. **File permission errors**: Ensure you have write permissions to the output folder

3. **Large file processing**: Very large images may take longer to process - this is normal

4. **RGBA to RGB conversion**: When converting PNG with transparency to JPEG, a white background is automatically added
